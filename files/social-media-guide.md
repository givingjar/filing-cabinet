# Giving Jar Social Media Guide

One of the early ways Giving Jar can help people discover nonprofits and encourage charitable giving is to provide a regular stream of news about charities and nonprofits. This is also a good way to share progress reports about Giving Jar.

## Buffer

Use [Buffer][1] to queue up all posts to social media. Use the [@givingjar][2] Twitter account to login. The [Buffer extension][3] for Chrome is also a useful tool to quickly queue up web content.

Always queue up content, do not post immediately. Buffer allows a content to be queued up and rolled out gradually for more consistent engagement. This consistent engagement is important for follower adoption and retention, but it is even more important for Giving Jar to provide a dependable source of information about nonprofits.

## Accounts

Giving Jar has accounts (or some equivalent) on the following social media sites:

* [Twitter][2]
* [Facebook][4]

## Schedule

The official posting schedule is managed in Buffer but for quick reference, here it is:

* Twitter
  * Every day at 11:36 AM
* Facebook
  * Every day at 9:02 AM

If you change the schedule in this document, please change it in Buffer as well (or vice-versa).

## Finding Content

When you find content to share, always make sure the article is less than one day old when you queue it up. Also double-check to make sure the article hasn't already been posted or queued!

### Feed Readers

A good way to gather up a lot of good sources of nonprofit and charitable giving information is to use a feed reader.

Try out [Feedly][5]. It has a good search tool for discovering sites and collections that are perfect for donors and nonprofits who may be interested in Giving Jar. Look for the "Must-Read Nonprofits" collection for a good source of nonprofit news articles.

### Google Alerts

Giving Jar has created the following [Google Alert][6] feeds as another convenient way to discover news on the web about nonprofits:

* [Google Alert RSS Feed for Charity][7]
* [Google Alert RSS Feed for Donations][8]
* [Google Alert RSS Feed for Nonprofits][9]

Use a feed reader to follow these alerts. Alternatively, you can create your own alerts on keywords such as "nonprofit", "charity", "donation", and so on.

## Writing Content

* **Be positive!**
  Avoid using negative words and phrases and please, please do not link to content that paints nonprofits and charitable giving in a bad way!
* **Stick to 140 characters.**
  This lets us write material once and post it to all connected accounts without any text getting chopped off. Of course, if you really *want* to write separate blurbs for each account you are welcome to do so!
* **Post to all accounts.**
  All linked accounts in Buffer should automatically get posted to, but please make sure all accounts are selected before queueing up a new post.
* **Always include a link.**
  For original Giving Jar content, link to the corresponding website or blog post. For links to external articles, link to the original source of information (e.g. avoid linking to Wikipedia, news aggregators such as Hacker News, etc.).
* **Find a good image.**
  If the link in the post does not generate a social preview with a good thumbnail then save an image from the linked page and upload it as a custom thumbnail. This will provide a nice eye-catching peek into the linked content. If there isn't a good image on the linked page, try the "Create an Image" feature in Buffer.
* **Find good hashtags.**
  The articles we link to can be shared with more than just Giving Jar followers if good hashtags are used. The easiest way to find good hashtags is to do a Twitter search using the title of the linked article.
* **Reread the post.**
  Even in as few as 140 characters it is easy to slip up and misspell or phrase something strangely. Reread your post out loud to make sure it sounds great.
