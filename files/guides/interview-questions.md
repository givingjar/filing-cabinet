# Questions for Nonprofits

The goal of these questions is to help understand nonprofits from multiple perspectives. In addition to the basic questions anyone may be interested in, there are a number of questions specifically important to donors, Giving Jar, and other nonprofits/charities.

The actual interview will cover more ground than will appear in the published charity spotlight, but the complete interview will be available in the Giving Jar filing cabinet.

## Interview Techniques

Encourage the interviewee to tell a story by using the following lead-in questions.

* *"Tell me when ..."*
* *"Describe ..."*
* *"What were the steps that ..."*

Capture the emotion behind the story with these follow-up questions.

* *"How did that make you feel?"*
* *"It sounds like that made you <emotion>. Could you elaborate on that?"*
* *"Why is this meaningful to you?"*

Ask someone to reflect on both sides of their story.

* *"Was there ever a time that you felt differently?"*
* *"When did you view/opinion change?"*
* *"What would your younger/older self say to you in that situation?"*
* *"What do you make of that?"*

When someone is telling a story, let them! Avoid interrupting them with your own remarks.

## Required Topics

The following sections should appear in every charity spotlight. Make sure these topics are thoroughly covered by the questions asked during every interview.

### 1. Origin Story

This section should answer the "Why" questions about the charity. The purpose of this section is not simply to restate the mission, but to explain a specific problem that the founder(s) identified and felt passionate about addressing.

The origin story can also provide insight into other interesting aspects of the charity, founders, location, etc. that readers may care about.

### 2. Today

Explain all of the programs that the charity uses to implement its mission. When there are too many programs to describe, categorize and generalize the programs and link to a page on the charity's site where more information can be found.

### 3. Big Wins

Victories for a charity may be stories about individuals that have been helped, they might be the aggregated, sheer volume of how much support has been provided, or anything and everything in between. Let the interviewee decide what goes in this section.

### 4. Goals

Charities are always looking for ways to further the progress toward their mission. Goals for charities are very much in the eye of the beholder. One charity may want to operate more efficiently whereas another may want to expand their programs or raise more money.

Goals can also be short-term or long-term. Try to capture a variety of goals and describe them as succinctly as possible.

### 5. Advice for Nonprofits

People running charities are knowledgeable of more than just their charity's mission and operations, they also know tips and tricks about starting and running a nonprofit business. These tips can be invaluable for someone interested in founding a new charity, but they can also be useful to other charities, donors, and volunteers.

### 6. Advice for Donors or Volunteers

This section is dedicated to helping donors and volunteers become more informed in the decisions they make when committing themselves to a cause or charity. The advice can be motivational or it can be gotchas. Whatever advice is offered, try to explore the unique perspective of the charity that would make this advice eye-opening.
