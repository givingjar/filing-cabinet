# Giving Jar Social Media Guide

One of the early ways Giving Jar can help people discover nonprofits and encourage charitable giving is to provide a regular stream of news about charities and nonprofits. This is also a good way to share progress reports about Giving Jar.

## Buffer

Use [Buffer][1] to queue up all posts to social media. Use the [@givingjar][2] Twitter account to login. The [Buffer extension][3] for Chrome is also a useful tool to quickly queue up web content.

Always queue up content, do not post immediately. Buffer allows a content to be queued up and rolled out gradually for more consistent engagement. This consistent engagement is important for follower adoption and retention, but it is even more important for Giving Jar to provide a dependable source of information about nonprofits.

## Accounts

Giving Jar has accounts (or some equivalent) on the following social media sites:

* [Twitter][2]
* [Facebook][4]

## Schedule

The official posting schedule is managed in Buffer but for quick reference, here it is:

* Twitter
  * Every day at 10:36 AM
* Facebook
  * Every day at 9:02 AM

If you change the schedule in this document, please change it in Buffer as well (or vice-versa).

## Finding Content

Giving Jar's social media content is intended to be specifically meaningful to Michigan residents. Find newsworthy examples of giving, special events, and so on around the state of Michigan. Celebrities from Michigan performing charitable deeds typically make great social copy too. Double-check to make sure the article hasn't already been posted or queued!

While it's possible to create [Google Alerts][6] and use a feed reader such as [Feedly][5] to find charity news, there is often so many misleading or entirely missed pockets of news that it's usually easier to perform a search for terms such as "michigan charity" on [Google News][7] or [Bing News][8]. Bing News has the benefit of letting you restrict your search to the past several days and sort by most recent news.

## Writing Content

Here are some general tips when writing headlines for articles shared on social media.

* **Be positive!**
  Avoid using negative words and phrases and please, please do not link to content that paints nonprofits and charitable giving in a bad way!
* **Post to all accounts.**
  All linked accounts in Buffer should automatically get posted to, but please make sure all accounts are selected before queueing up a new post.
* **Always include a link.**
  For original Giving Jar content, link to the corresponding website or blog post. For links to external articles, link to the original source of information (e.g. avoid linking to Wikipedia, news aggregators such as Hacker News, etc.).
* **Find a good image.**
  If the link in the post does not generate a social preview with a good thumbnail then save an image from the linked page and upload it as a custom thumbnail. This will provide a nice eye-catching peek into the linked content. If there isn't a good image on the linked page, try the "Create an Image" feature in Buffer.
* **Find good hashtags.**
  The articles we link to can be shared with more than just Giving Jar followers if good hashtags are used. The easiest way to find a good hashtag is search on Twitter using the title of the linked article.
* **Reread the post.**
  Even in as few as 140 characters it is easy to misspell or phrase something strangely. Read your post out loud to make sure it sounds great.

### Twitter Tips

Buffer will automatically include the title of the article, a link, and a picture. Don't stop there, though. Start by formatting the tweet as follows:

    Article Title or Summary http://buff.ly/link via @Source #MIgives

Only use the `#MIgives` hashtag if the linked article directly involves Michigan people giving or doing something charitable.

### Facebook Tips

The article preview in Facebook will already include the title, author/source, link, and image. Don't include any of this information in the message portion of the Facebook share.

What is needed in the Facebook post is a little message to highlight something important or especially positive from the article. Read the article and write a short sentence or two about something you took away from the article.

For example:

    "The lists are organized by cause to help you find the right place to donate. The article includes some nice tips to avoid charity scams too."
